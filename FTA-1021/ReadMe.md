# [Turbo Campaign](https://www.fidelissecurity.com/resources/turbo-campaign-featuring-derusbi-64-bit-linux)
In the summer of 2015, Fidelis Cybersecurity had the opportunity to analyze a Derusbi malware sample used as part of a campaign weâ€™ve labeled Turbo, for the associated kernel module that was deployed. Derusbi has been widely covered and associated with Chinese threat actors. This malware has been reported to have been used in high profile breaches like the ones at Wellpoint/Anthem, VAE Inc, USIS and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Every one of these campaigns involved a Windows version of Derusbi.

The sample we uncover is the Linux 64-bit version.

### Hash Research
We crafted a yara rule based on the beacon strings found in the Linux 64-bit Derusbi and detected the following twenty-five (25) Windows version of Derusbi samples.  These files include 32-bit and 64-bit files, Dynamic Link Library (DLL) samples, and EXE samples where majority of the files detected appeared to have been compiled in 2011. These results helped us trace a stronger correlations between known Windows version of Derusbi with the Linux version of the report. The following are MD5 hashes of the samples detected:
