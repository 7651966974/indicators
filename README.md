# indicators

The following is a listing of indicators from Fidelis Cybersecurity blog posts and FTAs.

In the main directory is a master list of IPs, Hostnames and SHA256 hashses.

Subdirectories are for specific FTAs or blog posts and will be linked in posts.

This directory will also include a CIF config to routinely query and directly import our indicators into CIF.
