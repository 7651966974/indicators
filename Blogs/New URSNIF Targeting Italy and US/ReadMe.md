# [New Ursnif Variant Targeting Italy and U.S](http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/new-ursnif-variant-targeting-italy-and-us.html)
Fidelis Cybersecurity has been investigating a new variant of Ursnif, a family of trojans that captures and reports information about user activity back to the attacker. We recently observed the variant distributed in phishing runs designed to appear as legitimate banking-related emails. On infected hosts, it attempts to perform webinjects to capture credentials for major U.S. banking sites, including Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, USAA and Capital One. Interestingly, it takes screenshots when victims visit a variety of Italian sites, such as Unicredit, Poste and Relax Banking. To evade detection, it also blocks access to a surprisingly large number of security-related websites. What specifically grabbed our attention was the change in command-and-control traffic that distinguishes it from standard Ursnif.

Even as ransomware dominates the headlines, banking trojans are a profitable mainstay of the criminal domain. As recently reported, ransomware like CryptXXX has acquired credential-theft capabilities, signaling a marriage of sorts within the crime family. Banking trojans have been the vehicle for numerous innovations in malware over the years. These developments in Ursnif show us that technical investment across the crime domain continues. The targeting of Italian and U.S. financial institutions also points to the global scope of opportunity for such criminal actors.

[This post covers our analysis of these changes and how we reversed them. Further, we share configuration details as well as IOCs.](http://www.threatgeek.com/2016/06/new-ursnif-variant-targeting-italy-and-us.html)
